### Hello there!
I am Robert Robinson, (also known as DigitalNomad112) being 27 years old, living in North Carolina. Now coming into the technology/buisness speheres for my own enrichment and skills. Going throught the TripleTen program, I was given a background for buisiness technology and plan to use it to the best of my ability.
In my spare time, I like to experiment with baking and cooking. I particularly like to bake cookies, and I try to appreciate different cultures through cooking for other people.
I would very much like to participate in outsourcing projects, if any are available to me.
I can read, filter, and parse through data, and also make charts, graphs, and projections using said data as well.
Include a link to your portfolio, resume, and LinkedIn.
